### Note
1. Server will only work as long as the cloud shell terminal is opened , (install chrome on rdp and open the shell terminal there to fix).
2. Server will only work 50 hours/week, so get 2-3 google accounts if you want to always use it.
3. If you restarted the server, you need to do all the steps again.
4. Contact https://t.me/patheticprogrammers for help.
